## About the Course
{:.mt-0}

This course introduces students to the design and implementation of operating systems.
Students will be exposed to a wide variety of topics, including:
processes, threads, concurrent programming, scheduling, memory, files, I/O management, and security issues.
The course will conclude with a series of advanced topics.

The course emphasizes "learning by doing," and requires students to engage in frequent discussions around design and trade-offs,
as well as programming-intensive activities.
<!-- Throughout most of this course,  -->
In the second half of this course,
<!-- students will work together in small teams to develop their own operating system known as *Yalnix*. -->
students will work together in small teams ~~to develop their own operating system known as *Yalnix*~~ to explore an OS-related project.

- [CSCI 112 --- C Programming](http://catalog.montana.edu/search/?P=CSCI%20112) **(strongly recommended)**
- [CSCI 232 --- Data Structures and Algorithms](http://catalog.montana.edu/search/?P=CSCI%20232) **(required)**
- [CSCI 366 --- Computer Systems](http://catalog.montana.edu/search/?P=CSCI%20366) **(required)** <br/>
   or [CSCI 361 --- Computer Architecture](http://catalog.montana.edu/search/?P=CSCI%20361) **(required)** *>> now defunct* <br/>
   or [EELE 371 --- Microprocess HW and SW Systems](http://catalog.montana.edu/search/?P=EELE%20371) **(required)**.

If you do not have any of the above prerequisites, you should touch base with me as soon as possible.
I'm generally not concerned if you are concurrently enrolled in a prerequisite course,
